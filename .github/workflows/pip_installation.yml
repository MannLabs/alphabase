# Perform pip installation and run all tests

# For feature branches, we don't test the full matrix (os x [stable, loose]) in order to save time & resources.
# On each push to main, the whole test matrix runs.
# In the (assumed to be rare case) that these full matrix tests fail but the reduced matrix tests passed,
# we will learn about it latest after pushing to main. The merge that caused the issue can then be identified.
